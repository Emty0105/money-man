      'You can use "Recurring Transactions" function (under "Tools" section for Android version) in Navigation panel. Please be aware that the concept for recurring transaction is kinda similar to an automatic method to add repetitive transactions. You will only see the transactions in your wallet when it reaches the time you have anticipated in the setting of recurring transactions. Therefore, be patient when you add recurring transaction and have not seen it in the transaction list. Try setting the nearest time (about next 3-5 minutes) to see how the function works. To change the repeating mode, tap the "Repeat Daily" to see other options or anticipate the number of days that such transaction will repeat in the future in line "Every 1 day".',
